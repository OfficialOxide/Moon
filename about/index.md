Hey, I'm lambda, also known as:
- Oxide
- OfficialOxide

As you can see at the bottom of this page, I'm a hobbyist programmer. I only picked up programming in late January of 2017, and have been doing it ever since. I code my small sized programs in Python, my corporate overlord programs in Java, and I'm currently learning Haskell from [this book](https://haskellbook.com).

You can visit [my github profile](https://github.com/OfficialOxide) and my [other website](http://oxyde.cf).

I also use zsh and I can't get enough of customizing my shell prompt.
