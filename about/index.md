Hey, you've reached the website of Oxide.
As you can see at the bottom of this page, I'm a hobbyist programmer. I only picked up programming in late January of 2017, and have been doing it ever since. I code my small sized programs in Python, my corporate overlord programs in Java, and I'm currently learning Haskell from [this book](https://haskellbook.com).

You can visit [my github profile](https://github.com/OfficialOxide) and my [other website](http://oxyde.ga).

I love to read books. From cheap thrillers to Marcus Aurelius's Meditations, I'll pick up and read just about anything.
I also write about self improvement sometimes. Okay, maybe a lot.
