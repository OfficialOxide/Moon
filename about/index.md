Hey, you've reached the website of Oxide.

I'm a hobbyist programmer and mathematics student. I only picked up programming in late January of 2017, and have been doing it ever since. I code my small sized programs in Python, my corporate overlord programs in Java, and I'm currently learning Haskell from [this book](https://haskellbook.com).

You can visit [my github profile](https://github.com/OfficialOxide) and my [other website](http://oxyde.ga).

My other interests are philosophy, linguistics, and in depth analyses of GTA games.
