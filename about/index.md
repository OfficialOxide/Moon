Hey, you've reached the website of Oxide.

I'm a student of mathematics and occasional programmer.

I am interested in algebra and logic, especially different types of lambda calculi and type theories.

I mainly work in Haskell, Python and C, although I have also learnt (and loved) Scheme while reading SICP.

You can visit [my github profile](https://github.com/OfficialOxide) and my [other website](http://oxyde.cf). I am also on Discord as Oxide#5973.

My other interests are philosophy, linguistics, and theoretical computer science. (Type theory?)
