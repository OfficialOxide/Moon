Learning mathematics can feel like being caught in a flood of definitions one needs to remember and details one needs to be vigilant of.
But once you've learned enough background material, you don't need the scaffolding[^1] that so many textbooks provide.
Many topics in mathematics and physics follow from a few core ideas and some general considerations, and the rest reduces to checking details.[^2]

[^1]: Or babysitting, to be more derisive.
[^2]: I don't mean to say that checking details is without value, but that the beginner can often miss the forest for the trees when neck-deep in details.

By general considerations, I mean special cases you already know, intuition, common sense, et cetera.
This is not trivial to develop, but once you have it, your mathematical education can become far more streamlined.

# Example
*All* of special relativity is contained in the following two statements:
- The speed of light in a vacuum is equal for all observers.
- The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference.

You can derive the fundamental notions such as the [Minkowski metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_space#Minkowski_metric), [light cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone), and [Lorentz transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation) from the above statement, 
plus general considerations like recovering Newtonian mechanics by letting $$c\to\infty$$.

Many textbooks don't do that, however. 
Contrary to the unity of the ideas, their exposition is fractured.
They'll introduce the principle of relativity, and then start explaining the Minkowski metric out of thin air.
The one exception I've found is the wonderful book *[The Classical Theory of Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_of_Theoretical_Physics#Volume_2)* by Landau and Lifschitz.

# Post-rigour
This is similar to Terence Tao's [concept](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/) of mathematical education progressing as pre-rigour→rigour→post-rigour. 
But the idea of core concepts+general considerations can be carried out at any level, not just at post-rigour.

# Danger
There's also a danger in knowing this superficially, of course. Shallow consumption of the ‘[Pierian spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierian_Spring)’ of this concept leads to the now-ubiquitous undergraduate category theorist:

The real issue here is not category theory, but rather its overeager application as the person tries to chase the feeling of mathematical insight.
