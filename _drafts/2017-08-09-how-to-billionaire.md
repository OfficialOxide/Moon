> Most importantly: Are you willing to give up being understood by every person you know?

This really resonated with me. I think this is in line with what Howard Mark said in his book ['The Most Important Thing'](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B004U5Q1O0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B004U5Q1O0&linkCode=as2&tag=lambda0b-21&linkId=d5db8d1cc0b2e0823780aa6885a18617). He said, that to be have better results than anyone, you need to have unconventional thinking. But that unconventional thinking needs to right. Only then you can get better results. 

Think of how Steve Jobs revolutionized the design of hardware and leveraged the human instinct to judge books by their covers.

Ideas must be refined and formulated in a way to leverage human behavior.

Without thinking, choose one:

- A burger which is 98% fat free.
- A burger which is 2% fat.

This is called [framing](https://goo.gl/Cq5WQp), and even though both of the choices are the same thing, most people will choose the first. This thought experiment was a simple way to leverage human psychology in order to persuade them to buy your idea. 

Revolutionary products only come from [great ideas + brilliant execution](https://sivers.org/multiply).
