Welcome to hell.

*swivels in chair, turns to face you*

**I have been expecting you.**

But seriously though, welcome, and enjoy the future posts.
I'll usually write about Linux, programming and sometimes, font rendering. I have no idea why I'm so crazy about fonts. Or anything for that matter.
My programming languages of choice is Python, mostly. Sometimes I use Java, and oh god I've forgotten how to write Java- and I'm currently learning Haskell.

I'll also write about shells (not sea shells! think bash or zsh), and how to hide your victims most effectively.
