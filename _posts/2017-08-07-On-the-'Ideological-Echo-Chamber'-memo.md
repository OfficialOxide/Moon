An anonymous Google software engineer made a memo about the ideological echo chamber of Google. It's being attacked by most leftist media as 'anti-diversity' and 'racist'.

They're just cherry picking some of his arguments out of context, and ignoring the ones *promoting* diversity.

### So, I'm going to make a list of statements that were in support of diversity to show their stupidity.



> We can make software engineering more people-oriented with pair programming and more collaboration.

In continuation of how women are more social than men.

> Allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive. This doesn’t mean that we should remove all competitiveness from Google. Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we shouldn’t necessarily disadvantage those that have them. Women on average are more prone to anxiety. Make tech and leadership less stressful.

In response to how women are more agreeable and more cooperative than competitive.

> Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work though can keep more women in tech.

After showing how women often quit jobs/take lower positions due to stress of high level jobs.

> If we, as a society, allow men to be more “feminine,” then the gender gap will shrink, although probably because men will leave tech and leadership for traditionally feminine roles.

> My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don’t fit a certain ideology. I’m also not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite the opposite: treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism).

This is actual true diversity. The one that comes after racial and gender diversity.

> Stop restricting programs and classes to certain genders or races.

Why would you?

> We should empower those with different ideologies to be able to express themselves.


>  Being emotionally unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.


> Speaking up without the fear of being harshly judged is central to psychological safety, but these practices can remove that safety by judging unintentional transgressions.

Nowadays, a conservative person in college can't open their mouth without having the fear of being attacked, either physically, or having their reputations, and thus, careers, ruined.

> Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary

Exactly. Denial of peer reviewed scientific studies won't make it untrue.


### A few more things that I'd like to add here.


The funny thing is that the *very* paper that calls for ideological diversity in organizations is being attacked for its ideology, and being considered for being taken down by Google execs.

This is what Ari Balogh said:
> Building an open, inclusive environment is core to who we are, and the right thing to do. ‘Nuff said.

Not inclusive and open to opinions other to your own?

He also said:
> One of the aspects of the post that troubled me deeply was the bias inherent in suggesting that most women, or men, feel or act a certain way. That is stereotyping, and it is harmful.

Scientific evidence is harmful?<sup>[1]</sup> I didn't know that. Or maybe it's just the scientific evidence you disagree with.
In fact, the Left will create an outrage at the results of any study they disagree with.<sup>[1]</sup>
