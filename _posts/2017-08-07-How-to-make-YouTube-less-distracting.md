### Youtube is either one of the best sources of information, or one of the world's greatest time wasters.

In this one, I'm going to show you how to make it almost free from distractions and full of useful content.

Steps:

First, we're gonna remove the comments since most of them are useless and will probably lead to endless scrolling.

- Install AdBlock (for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/) or [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom)), and then, click on any video.
- After that, right click on the comment section, click "Block this ad", and move the slider to the right till it blocks the whole comment section, it should look like this.

Now, we're going to block some distracting channels.
- Get a video/channel blocker extension (for [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-blocker/jknkjnpcbbgcbdbaampbjlhkcghmgfhk?hl=en) & for [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/video-blocker/))
- Block all distracting channels, by right clicking on their videos and then clicking "Block videos from this channel". You'll never see them again.

And the final step:
- Unsubscribe from those distracting channels that you're subscribed to (you know you are).

And that's how you, hopefully, make YouTube much less distracting than it was before.
